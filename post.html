              Google has been investing in AI for many years and bringing its
              benefits to individuals, businesses and communities. Whether it’s
              publishing state-of-the-art research, building helpful products or
              developing tools and resources that enable others, we’re committed
              to making AI accessible to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re now at a pivotal moment in our AI journey. Breakthroughs in
              generative AI are fundamentally changing how people interact with
              technology — and at Google, we’ve been responsibly developing
              large language models so we can safely bring them to our products.
              Today, we’re excited to share our early progress. Developers and
              businesses can now try new APIs and products that make it easy,
              safe and scalable to start building with Google’s best AI models
              through Google Cloud and a new prototyping environment called
              MakerSuite. And in Google Workspace, we’re introducing new
              features that help people harness the power of generative AI to
              create, connect and collaborate.
            </p>

              <p>
                “People worry that computers will get too smart and take over
                the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and
                they’ve already taken over the world.”
              </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>
              More than 3 billion people already benefit from AI-powered
              features in Google Workspace, whether it’s using Smart Compose in
              Gmail or auto-generated summaries in Google Docs. Now, we’re
              excited to take the next step and bring a limited set of trusted
              testers a new set of features that makes the process of writing
              even easier. In Gmail and Google Docs, you can simply type in a
              topic you’d like to write about, and a draft will be instantly
              generated for you. So if you’re a manager onboarding a new
              employee, Workspace saves you the time and effort involved in
              writing that first welcome email. From there, you can elaborate
              upon or abbreviate the message or adjust the tone to be more
              playful or professional — all in just a few clicks. We’ll be
              rolling out these new experiences to testers in the coming weeks.

            <p>
              We’re so excited by the potential of generative AI, and the
              opportunities it will unlock – from helping people express
              themselves creatively, to helping developers build new types of
              applications, to transforming how businesses and governments
              engage their customers and constituents. Stay tuned for more to
              come in the weeks and months ahead.
